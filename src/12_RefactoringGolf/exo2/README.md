# Exo 2 to Exo 3

## Refactorings

- Tackle dead code
  - Delete dead code

## Tips

- Use a diff tool to identify the code changes you need to perform
- Check the code coverage is enough to detect any unintended behaviour changes

### While refactoring

- Stay in the green while refactoring
  - Run the tests after each refactor
    - Check all tests still pass
    - Check code coverage has not dropped
- Commit after each refactor
- In case of persistent test fails, use `git reset` to go back to green
